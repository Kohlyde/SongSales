                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <h4>Initial Relocation and Interactions</h4>
                            <p>Details: In an effort to start anew, I relocated to Boise, Idaho. Upon arrival, I
                                received minimal assistance from friends, with Kris Geldings being the only one who
                                helped me unload my truck. Despite others promising support, they did not follow
                                through.</p>

                            <h4>July 4-5 Incident at AMI’s Mother’s House</h4>
                            <p>Details: During the Independence Day weekend, after a few days of partying at Kris’s
                                house, I moved to AMI’s mother’s house. Brian Topping, acting erratically, approached
                                AMI and cruelly told her, “I don’t even f*cking love you,” causing her significant
                                emotional distress. I provided comfort to AMI during this time.</p>

                            <h4>September 22 Incident at the Oasis Festival</h4>
                            <p>Details: On September 22, 2022, during the trip to the Oasis Festival near Mountain Home
                                Air Force Base, Brian's behavior became increasingly erratic. He made incoherent
                                statements, claiming to be God and accusing AMI of controlling him. This culminated in a
                                public outburst on stage, causing a scene that embarrassed everyone involved. Shaggy
                                Rogers, a respected figure at the festival, intervened, telling Brian to leave the
                                stage.</p>

                            <h4>Brian’s Apology Attempts and Boundary Violations</h4>
                            <p>Details: Over the next few months, Brian made multiple attempts to apologize for his
                                actions, but his apologies were insincere. Despite setting clear boundaries, Brian
                                repeatedly violated them, particularly during the Kristmas and New Year period.</p>

                            <h4>Introduction of Female A and Female B</h4>
                            <p>Details: Two new individuals, Female A and Female B, sought refuge from Brian’s behavior at
                                my house. One night, while I was teaching them to play cribbage, Brian arrived
                                uninvited, attempted to apologize, but indicated he didn’t want to discuss his behavior.
                                He stayed for most of the evening, making inappropriate advances towards Female B, who
                                refused.</p>

                            <h4>Kris’s Tragic Death</h4>
                            <p>Details: In a tragic turn of events, Kris died from a fentanyl overdose a couple of
                                months ago. He had consumed the drug assuming it was cocaine. This incident happened on
                                Sentinel, adding a layer of suspicion and highlighting the potential dangers associated
                                with the risky behaviors influenced by Brian.</p>

                            <h4>Thanksgiving Incident (Incident #10)</h4>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Kris organized a well-planned Thanksgiving dinner.</li>

                                <li>Brian was in the basement while the rest of the guests were in the living room.</li>
                                <li>AMI arrived and immediately engaged in conversation with Brian, indicating potential

                                <li>Over the past six months, I had been in regular contact with AMI, providing support
                                    through daily conversations.</li>
                                <li>Anticipating potential conflict, I decided to leave the event to avoid triggering my
                                    PTSD symptoms.</li>
                                <li>I informed Tanya Seehan of my decision to stay home and manage my symptoms.</li>
                                <li>From my bedroom, I observed AMI, Brian, and two others approaching my yard.</li>
                                <li>Recognizing the individuals from a previous incident involving Brian, I prepared
                                    myself for a potential confrontation.</li>
                                <li>I stepped out onto the front porch and addressed the group, clearly stating that I
                                    was experiencing a PTSD episode and requested they not enter my home.</li>
                                <li>Despite my clear communication, AMI attempted to push her way inside, breaching my
                                    boundary.</li>
                                <li>I calmly guided AMI back outside without any physical harm.</li>
                                <li>Inside my home, I expressed my frustration, but no one was hurt or assaulted.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Concern with Tanya</h4>
                            <p>Tanya Seehan is a close associate of Brian and has been known to follow his instructions without
                                question. She was present during both the July 4-5 incident and the Thanksgiving
                                incident. Due to her potential bias and loyalty to Brian, her statements and actions
                                should be scrutinized carefully. There is a significant concern that Tanya Seehan might provide
                                false information or try to manipulate the situation on Brian’s behalf.</p> -->

                                    Force Base, Brian's behavior became increasingly erratic. He made incoherent
                                    statements, claiming to be God and accusing AMI of controlling him. This culminated
                                    in a public outburst on stage, causing a scene that embarrassed everyone involved.
                                    Shaggy Rogers, a respected figure at the festival, intervened, telling Brian to

                            <p><strong>Heightened Hypervigilance and Paranoia:</strong> Continuous defamation increases
                                anxiety and hypervigilance. (APA, 2013)</p>
                            <p><strong>Increased Emotional Outbursts:</strong> Constant attacks lead to frequent
                                emotional outbursts. (Van Der Kolk, 2014)</p>
                            <p><strong>Exacerbation of Symptoms:</strong> The stress from defamation exacerbates
                                symptoms of CPTSD, ADHD, and twice-exceptionality. (Smith et al., 2020)</p>

                                <li><strong>Paranoia and Hypervigilance:</strong> The defamation has heightened paranoia
                                    and hypervigilance, causing constant fear and anxiety. (APA, 2013)</li>
                                <li><strong>Emotional Distress:</strong> The false accusations and public outbursts have

                                    commitments. (Van Der Kolk, 2014)</li>
                                <li><strong>Need for Therapy:</strong> Continuous psychological harm necessitates

                            showing a deep sense of remorse. I forgave him because I could see his sincerity. During
                            that conversation, I told him, "If you and I are going to be friends, then you cannot
                            include Brian Topping in your life because Brian Topping will influence you to do things to
                            me." Kris's response was clear and resolute: "I don’t ever wanna talk to that ******* guy
                            ever again."</p>

                            distance himself from them spoke volumes about his character. He valued honesty and
                            integrity, and his actions reflected his commitment to maintaining positive relationships.
                            Kris’s legacy is not just his music but also the genuine connections he made and the

                                Kris was a remarkable individual with an extensive knowledge of electronic music. The

                                often incorporated into his sets. Kris had an incredible ability to understand and

                                integrity, and his actions reflected his commitment to maintaining positive
                                relationships. Kris’s legacy is not just his music but also the genuine connections he
                                made and the positive impact he had on the lives of those around him.
